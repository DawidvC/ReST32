  "tagline": "A modular 3D Printer Controller based on the STM32Duino project",
  "body": "### A powerfull yet low-cost tool for your 3D Printer\r\nIt comes with a powerful 72Mhz ARM Cortex-M3 Microcontroller by STMicroelectronics, with 512KB of Flash and 64KB of SRAM on board. This Microcontroller is more than 6 times faster in FPU than a AVR-Based Controller, making it suitable for Delta-Style Printers.\r\n\r\n### Safety First\r\nThis controller has safety in mind. Instead of using PTC Resettable fuses, which get triggered by heat they generate, and not the current and also wear out the more often they get triggered, the ReST32 uses automotive fuses, which are much more reliable and are easy and cheap to replace, while also being much smaller than PTC Fuses.\r\nIt also contains a reverse polarity diode, so that if you wire it wrong, the board wont get destroyed.\r\nThe 5V and 3.3V Power Lines are also protected with a small fuse.\r\n\r\nThe low-resistance AOT240L Mosfet are more than capable to handle the loads of a normal 3D Printer without problems. The ReST32 also contains a freewheeling diode, to protect the Mosfets from reverse voltage and inductive voltage spikes from heaters and heatbeds.\r\n\r\nYou can also use two thermistors heaters and heatbeds simultaniously, so that if one fails, the other one will read the temperature, protecting your printer from overheating and [potentially burning down your house](https://3dprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_1259_zps950e6e59.jpg).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expandability\r\nAlthough the ReST32 is capable of dual Extrusions, you get an extra 10 IO Pins to play around with, aswell as two Servo Motor Headers. The LCD and SPI Connector is also very capable and rich of IO. It has an SPI Port with 2 CS Pins and Connection for a 8 bit Parallel LCD with 4 Control Pins and an extra PWM Pin to use with f.ex. Backlights with Full Color Displays.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is a SD Card Adapter and an Adapter to use the popular RepRapDiscount Full Graphic Smart Controller.\r\n\r\n### Modularity\r\nInstead of soldering the Stepper Drivers directly to the ReST32, using a Pololu Stepper Driver is much better, because you can change it out to suit your need or if something goes wrong.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n+ STM32F103VET6 Cortex-M3 Microcontroller with 512KB Flash, 64KB SRAM running at 72MHz\r\n+ 256Kb External EEPROM for Settings, etc.\r\n+ 3 AOT240L for Heatbed and 2 Heaters\r\n+ 5 Sockets for Pololu-style stepper motor drivers.\r\n+ 2 Automotive mini fuses, one for the electronics and the steppers motors and another for the heatbed and the heaters.\r\n+ Reverse Polarity protection on the Power Inputs.\r\n+ 12-24V Voltage Input\r\n+ 1.5A on the 5V Rail, 1A on the 3.3V Rail, both of them are individually fused.\r\n+ 4 Additional high load connectors for controllable fans, LEDS, etc.\r\n+ Extra Power Pins for the different Voltages to connect things to.\r\n+ 6 Endstop Connectors\r\n+ 6 Thermistor Connectors (for maximum redundancy)\r\n+ High Quality Buck Converters.\r\n+ ESD-Safe Micro USB Port\r\n+ Selectable Power Rail for the Electronics: External Power or the USB Port.\r\n+ ESP-01 Header to use it as an Webserver\r\n+ 8 Extra GPIO to tinker with\r\n+ I2C, UART, SWD Pin headers.\r\n\r\n### Availability\r\nThe board is currently in development. The next prototype is going to be ordered soon. If it works, then the first few Controllers are available. \r\n\r\nHere are photos of the Gerbers.\r\n\r\nMainboard Front:\r\n![Mainboard Front](http://puu.sh/qfrSq/35a3bdd032.png)\r\n___\r\nMainboard Back:\r\n![Mainboard Back](http://puu.sh/qfrUk/395e6d4ba2.png)\r\n___\r\nSD Card Front:\r\n![SD Card Front](http://puu.sh/qfrsa/337776318c.png)\r\n___\r\nSD Card Back:\r\n![SD Card Back](http://puu.sh/qfrvV/5153e81b4c.png)\r\n___\r\nRepRapDiscount FGD Adapter Front:\r\n![RepRapDiscount FGD Adapter Front](http://puu.sh/qfrxZ/548dd6d2ee.png)\r\n___\r\nRepRapDiscount FGD Adapter Back:\r\n![RepRapDiscount FGD Adapter Back](http://puu.sh/qfrBl/d048b72526.png)\r\n\r\n### Things to do:\r\n+ Check if the board is working properly\r\n+ Make Marlin (or Marlin4Due) compatible with the stm32duino core.\r\n+ Development of a Full Color LCD (ILI9341)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nEmail: matthias.marcus.nowak@gmail.com\r\n\r\nGithub: @berryelectronics\r\n\r\nTwitter: maker_berry\r\n",
