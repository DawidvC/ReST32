<p>It comes with a powerful 72Mhz ARM Cortex-M3 Microcontroller by STMicroelectronics, with 512KB of Flash and 64KB of SRAM on board. This Microcontroller is more than 6 times faster in FPU than a AVR-Based Controller, making it suitable for Delta-Style Printers.</p>

<a id="safety-first" class="anchor" href="#safety-first" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Safety First</h3>

<p>This controller has safety in mind. Instead of using PTC Resettable fuses, which get triggered by heat they generate, and not the current and also wear out the more often they get triggered, the ReST32 uses automotive fuses, which are much more reliable and are easy and cheap to replace, while also being much smaller than PTC Fuses.
It also contains a reverse polarity diode, so that if you wire it wrong, the board wont get destroyed.
The 5V and 3.3V Power Lines are also protected with a small fuse.
The low-resistance AOT240L Mosfet are more than capable to handle the loads of a normal 3D Printer without problems. The ReST32 also contains a freewheeling diode, to protect the Mosfets from reverse voltage and inductive voltage spikes from heaters and heatbeds.
You can also use two thermistors heaters and heatbeds simultaniously, so that if one fails, the other one will read the temperature, protecting your printer from overheating and <a href="https://3dprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_1259_zps950e6e59.jpg">potentially burning down your house</a>.</p>

<p>Although the ReST32 is capable of dual Extrusions, you get an extra 10 IO Pins to play around with, aswell as two Servo Motor Headers. The LCD and SPI Connector is also very capable and rich of IO. It has an SPI Port with 2 CS Pins and Connection for a 8 bit Parallel LCD with 4 Control Pins and an extra PWM Pin to use with f.ex. Backlights with Full Color Displays.
Currently, there is a SD Card Adapter and an Adapter to use the popular RepRapDiscount Full Graphic Smart Controller.</p>
